	Use:   "backy",
	Short: "Backup, Dotfiles and Tripwire all in one binary",
	Long: `
This application combines the functionality of backup management, dotfiles synchronization, and file integrity monitoring into a single versatile binary.

1. Backup Management:
   Easily configure and initiate backups of important files and directories.
	Customize backup schedules and destinations using a simple configuration file.

2. Dotfiles Synchronization:
   Streamline the management of your dotfiles across multiple systems.
	Ensure consistency and synchronization of configurations for applications like shells, editors, and more.

3. File Integrity Monitoring (Tripwire):
   Monitor changes in critical files and directories using cryptographic hash comparisons.
	Detect unauthorized modifications and maintain the integrity of your system.
For more details and usage examples, refer to the documentation or run the application with '--help'.
